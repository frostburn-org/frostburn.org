    %h1 2020 Decompression Cacnceled
    %p
      After careful consideration, review, and discussion the Frostburn team
      has made the call to cancel the Frostburn 2020 Decompression party. This
      decision was based on information made available from the local health
      department, the CDC, and WHO.

      As much as we want to see everyone again so soon after the burn, we would
      rather see everyone safe and healthy for Frostburn 2021.

      Please reach out if you have any questions.
      Share the warmth (but not the germs!)

      Frostburn is a regional event that brings Burning Man's desert spirit to the
      winter tundra; a music and arts festival, filled with music, art, fire, dancing,
      food, and all manner of cold weather fun.
    %p
      Since 2008, Frostburn has been creating unique ways to share our warmth with an
      ever growing group in a way that only Burners do.
    %p
      We look forward to seeing you on the Tundra!
