    %h1 Welcome to Frostburn!

      Frostburn's home is Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, West Virginia a short distance from Morgantown. 
      Frostburn <%= data.event.year %> will once again be held over President Day weekend, in February.
    %p
      Frostburn is a regional event that brings Burning Man's desert spirit to the
      winter tundra; a music and arts festival, filled with music, art, fire, dancing,
      food, and all manner of cold weather fun.
    %p
      Since 2008, Frostburn has been creating unique ways to share our warmth with an
      ever growing group in a way that only Burners do.
    %p
      We look forward to seeing you on the Tundra!
