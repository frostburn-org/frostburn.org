Many creative minds have made Frostburn the success that it is.

We would love to have you join our community, but please prepare by reading the
following pages that will help you understand the culture and be safe on the
Tundra.

Start with the <%= link_to "Frostburn Survival Guide",
"resources/MarvinsMountainTop-FrostburnSurvivalGuide.pdf" %>. Go ahead and read
it now, we'll be waiting here when you are done.

<%= link_to "Ten Principles",
"http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/" %> -
Straight from the source.

<%= link_to "FAQs", "/faq.html" %> - Frequently Asked Questions. 

<%= link_to "Volunteer", "/volunteer.html" %> - Frostburn is a participatory
event. Join our community and volunteer.

GPS directions are terrible; they may bring you in over the back of the
mountain, or up a rutted, narrow, pot holed road. Use these
<%= link_to "directions", "#{data.event.location_link}" %> from
downtown Masontown instead.

Keep up to date! Read our <%= link_to "Announcements and Updates",
"/AnnouncementsAndUpdates.html" %>.
