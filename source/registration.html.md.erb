### Early Arrival and Pre-Build


Frostburn Early Access privileges are available for those Tundrites who wish to construct some infrastructure, assemble their art grant, or are volunteering before gates open at noon on Thursday. There are two options for early access. Prebuild weekend is from noon on Saturday until sundown Sunday the weekend before tbe event. Early arrival begins Wednesday at 10am.

Requesting early access privileges is slightly different this year than in previous years so if you’ve done this before, pay attention!

<%= registration_link("early_access_individual") %>
