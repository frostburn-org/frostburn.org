Event Details and Resources
------

Downloadable 2019 Docs:

<%= link_to "What? Where? When? Guide",
    "/resources/Frostburn#{data.event.year}-WhatWhereWhenGuide.pdf" %>
&
<%= link_to "Event Map","/resources/Frostburn#{data.event.year}-EventMap.pdf" %>

Remember to read the <%= link_to "Frostburn Survival Guide",
                     "resources/MarvinsMountainTop-FrostburnSurvivalGuide.pdf"
                     %> and <%= link_to "FAQs", "/faq.html" %>

GPS directions are terrible. They may bring you in over the back of the
mountain, or up a rutted, narrow, pot holed road. Use these
<%= link_to "directions", "#{data.event.location_link}" %> from downtown
Masontown instead.
