- question: 'When is the last time you updated this FAQ'
  answer: "Before Frostburn 2020."

- question: 'Why did ticket prices increase in 2020?'
  answer: |
    We are now required to pay WV taxes on ticket sales. Additionally Brown
    Paper Tickets has increased their fees. Frostburn has chosen to begin
    passing fees on to participants.

- question: 'Can I visit the event site?'
  answer: |
    No, Frostburn is held on private property. Visting the site may jeopardize
    our ability to hold the event or your ability to attend.

- question: 'Am I allowed to camp in an RV?'
  answer: |
    Yes, you're welcome to camp in an RV, which will be placed in an specific
    area.  We have a level gravel packed parking lot near Gate that we recommend
    you use, but if you are experienced with your vehicle and feel that you can
    safely drive and park it in the main area we won't stop you, unless site
    conditions are preventing traffic flow inside the event (DPW, Gate Lead or
    Staff Members have the discretionary power to stop traffic flow at any time
    during the event.)

- question: 'Are electric campsites available and/or required for RV camping?'
  answer: |
    There are no hook-ups or electricity. Remember though propane can
    freeze!!!!! Bring space heaters and/or heated blankets for your RV in the
    event that temperatures get so low that the propane heat cannot be used.

- question: 'Are fireworks permitted? How about flamethrowers?'
  answer: |
    Fireworks and firearms are prohibited. There are no event or campground
    regulations prohibiting the use of flamethrowers or other fire-based devices
    for artistic purposes. Keep in mind that you alone are completely
    responsible for the safe operation, storage and installation of your
    dangerous art projects and devices. As in any community, Frostburn
    participants must obey all local, state and federal laws, including laws
    applicable to materials and devices used in your art projects. If you have
    any questions, seek qualified legal counsel.

- question: 'Are there any age restrictions? Any discounts for children or
    seniors?'
  answer: |
    Although participants of any age are welcome at Frostburn, please use the
    utmost discretion before you decide to bring children to the event: "radical
    self-expression" means that somebody might choose to express themselves in a
    way that your offspring might not be ready to confront! Campground
    regulations specify that minors are not permitted without a parent or legal
    (court-appointed) guardian (parental consent to attend is not enough). Do
    not let your child out of your sight; you alone are responsible for you
    child''s safety and behavior at all times! Sorry, but there are no age-based
    discounts.

- question: 'Are there restrooms? Showers?'
  answer: |
    There are porta-johns located throughout the campsite. No showers or other
    facilities unless you bring them. You may want to bring wet-wipes for a
    quick cleanup; just remember you need to keep them from freezing.

- question: 'Can I bring my dog? Cat? Hamster?  (Pets)'
  answer: |
    No, Pets are not allowed at Frostburn. Leave you furry (or not so furry)
    family members at home. Please contact us in advance if you have a
    registered service animal.

- question: 'Can I bring my own burn barrel?'
  answer: |
    Absolutely! We''d love to see more decorative burn barrels make an
    appearance at the event. Keeping your barrel off the ground or using
    portable fire pits are also recommended to reduce burn scars on the Tundra.

- question: 'Can I park near the camping area if I sleep in my car?'
  answer: |
    Only 4-wheel drive vehicles may drive on the site and park in the main
    camping area. There will be a non-amplified sound car and RV camping area
    down by the car park.

- question: 'Can we have our own fires? Can I bring firewood? Will firewood
    be available?'
  answer: |
    Yes, you may have campfires at your camp! Larger fires may be erected on
    grassy areas but must not be constructed on paved roadways and parking
    areas. Be sure to keep your fire a safe distance from people, trees and
    other objects. You must use wood from the county we are in, due to the
    Emerald Ash Borer firewood quarantine and our obligation to protect the
    environment. Note, that lumber and other building materials are not included
    in the quarantine, only firewood.

- question: 'Do I need a ticket?'
  answer: |
    Yes, tickets are required. All tickets are physical delivery or print at
    home. At the event when you check-in at the gate you will be given a site
    token or ticket which you must have with you at all times.

- question: 'How can I help?'
  answer: |
    Well, how do you want to help? Frostburn is an all-volunteer,
    community-sponsored event, so we can use pretty much any assistance you'd
    like to provide. To make a big impact, bring an art project, art car, theme
    camp, performance or seminar that encourages others to interact and
    participate. We need greeters to welcome people to the event, a DPW crew to
    help with set-up and tear-down, experienced EMTs, Rangers and Fire Safety
    personnel, gophers and folks to help with logistical matters. When you
    purchase your ticket we give you the opportunity to volunteer. Want to
    contribute in another way? Just let us know!

- question: 'How will we stay warm?'
  answer: |
    There are also theme camps which provide heated spaces and have fires for
    people to gather around. We are also asking attendees and especially theme
    camps to think of creative solutions on how we will keep each other warm. Of
    course for sleeping, your best friend is a good quality sleeping bag rated
    -20 or better. There is also one heated space for emergencies, but is not to
    be used as a social or gathering spot for attendees.

- question: 'I can only attend Frostburn one day. Is a per-day rate available?'
  answer: |
    No, prices are the same regardless of how many days you participate. We
    keep ticket prices as low as possible; ticket prices go up January 1st.

- question: 'I would like to create a theme camp, but I am afraid of
    duplicating someone else''s idea. How can I be sure not to step on someone
    else''s toes?'
  answer: |
    Firstly, don't worry too much about it! This isn't the senior prom, where
    everyone has to show up in a different gown. What's important is that you
    express yourself at the event, even if someone else feels the same way. That
    said, you can follow the Art, Theme Camps and Events links on our website to
    see what others are planning, and please submit any plans of your own. Feel
    free to collaborate with like-minded others, to create a project that is
    greater than the sum of its parts!

- question: 'I''m new to the "burn" concept. What should I expect?'
  answer: |
    It might sound cliché, but expect the unexpected! What happens to you at a
    burn depends largely on what you bring to the event. Unlike your typical
    festival, the features of a burn are defined by its attendees, which is why
    we call ourselves "participants." The burner community has a "NO SPECTATORS"
    rule, which means that, in a nutshell, if you come to the event expecting to
    be entertained, you will probably be disappointed. At a burn, you are the
    entertainer! You are the artist! You are the performer! If you don't have
    something to offer to the event, you arguably shouldn't be there. Bring an
    open mind, a willingness to try something new, and a desire to "share the
    warmth" with some of the most creative people on the planet!

- question: 'Is alcohol permitted?'
  answer: |
    Certainly! What would a burn be without booze? Remember, though, that the
    legal drinking age in West Virginia is twenty-one (21) years. You are
    responsible for keeping any alcohol you bring out of the hands (and bellies)
    of minors.

- question: 'Is vending permitted, Will there be food and drink sales?'
  answer: |
    No. All vending, advertising and other commercial activity is
    prohibited at Frostburn.   Please support our gift economy by sharing, not
    selling. Violators will be ejected without refund.

- question: 'I''ve been to Burning Man plenty of times. Other than
    Frostburn''s winter theme, what are the major cultural, legal or artistic
    differences?'
  answer: |
    Frostburn was envisioned to give artists the opportunity to experiment with
    materials and themes that simply aren't feasible in the desert or during the
    warmer months. We do support the same Ten Principles as Burning Man and
    other regional burns, so expect our culture to be similar. As at Burning
    Man, all Frostburn participants are expected to obey all applicable laws and
    event regulations. Campground regulations must also be followed.

- question: 'May I trade a service or something tangible in exchange for
    admission?'
  answer: |
    Sorry, but there's no way we could afford to host this year's event without
    everyone's financial commitment. Each and every person involved must
    purchase his or her own admission, regardless of other contributions. Quite
    frankly, it would help a lot if you could contribute even more than your
    admission price... so please donate as much time, money and effort to
    Frostburn as your heart, schedule and pocket can afford!

- question: 'What forms of art are welcome or encouraged?'
  answer: |
    All works of art are welcome at Frostburn, but participants tend to most
    appreciate interactive items: those that are animated or can be climbed,
    drawn upon or moved. You do not have to be an established artist; everyone
    at a burn is encouraged to express themselves artistically—and radically, at
    that! If you're an experienced artist, try a medium that you've never used
    before. Don't be afraid of failure; the important thing is that you try.
    Unlike other burns, Frostburn does not have an abstract "art theme." If you
    need inspiration, think about such concepts as communal warmth, winter
    adversity or the juxtaposition of hot and cold. Participants will gather
    around installations that provide comfort and protection from the elements!

- question: 'When does the gate open / close?'
  answer: |
    Generally the Gate will be open from Noon on Tursday - Saturday Night. The
    Gate may not be open 24h/day please see the current event details for
    specific dates and times.

- question: 'What do I do if I need more time to setup or teardown my camp?'
  answer: |
      Limited early access passes will be available. Please see the current
      event details for specific requirements. In the case of inclement
      weather safety always comes first. There is no unauthorised access to
      the site.

- question: 'Where can I cook? Where can I eat?'
  answer: |
    You can cook anywhere that you will not pose a health or safety hazard
    (including, but not limited to, oxygen depletion, pollution or unwanted
    fire). There are no restrictions on where you can eat, but if you eat in
    front of anyone else, be sure you have enough to share!

    There is no potable water on site, you need to bring everything with you. Do
    not drink, cook, clean, or bathe in any water you may find.

- question: 'Where do I go when I arrive?'
  answer: |
    You will all enter on main road for the venue. You must stop and check-in
    at the Gate. Our friendly volunteers will welcome you and point you in the
    right direction.


- question: 'Who''s running this thing?'
  answer: |
    This is an all-volunteer, community sponsored event. The Pittsburgh-area
    burner community, lead by a core group we call the Frostburn Planning
    Team, has rented or donated the infrastructure to provide the basic
    framework. However, as Frostburn community members, all participants are
    expected to contribute to the event's success by donating time, money and
    effort, and honoring our Ten Principles.

- question: 'Will security be present?'
  answer: |
    Non-confrontational community mediators called "Rangers" will be in
    attendance, to help resolve disputes and assist participants with health and
    safety issues. In addition to Rangers, Frostburn and campground staff can be
    approached with any concerns about public safety and security. Event staff
    reserves the right to evict anyone who violates regulations or poses a
    threat to our participants or venue. Before calling the police (yes, most
    cell phones will work at our venue), please try to resolve problems yourself
    or with our help, unless there is an emergency.

- question: 'Will there be a main/central stage for performances?'
  answer: |
    Short answer? Nope!  This is a full participation event, if you would like
    to build and curate  a stage for other participants to use we would love to
    see it happen!

- question: 'Will there be amplified sound? 24/7? Is there a quiet area?'
  answer: |
    Amplified sound is permitted during the event and we will do our best to
    make it 24/7. No large sound systems will be permitted during the early
    arrival period. There is no designated "quiet area," so bring earplugs or an
    RV if you're concerned about quiet time. Any sound camp that creates a
    disturbance for our neighbors may be relocated. As a last resort, we'll have
    no choice but to shut down repeat offenders.

- question: 'Will there be nudity?'
  answer: |
    If you're crazy enough to strip down in the middle of February, then we'll
    have a zone for you. As long as you're not visible to neighbors or
    passers-by, there shouldn't be a problem. You will definitely see nudity at
    Polar Bear Club swim in the creek (stream!)

- question: 'How can I hook up with an existing Theme Camp?'
  answer: |
    The whole camp? Depending on your personal preferences and the size of the
    camp one may just want to surreptitiously lick parts of the camp and attempt
    to claim them, Frostburn suggests no less than 95% coverage before
    attempting to make a claim. Otherwise we suggest checking out the Unofficial
    Frostburn Discussion Group on Facebook (see the contacts page for details).

- question: 'What is the weather like?'
  answer: |
    Variable. It's winter time, it has been as warm as shorts and tee shirt
    weather in the sun when working and as cold as -18 without windchill. Come
    prepared for mild temperatures, freezing temperatures, rain, snow, blizzard,
    and wind.

- question: 'What one thing should I worry about?'
  answer: |
    Only one?</br></br>

    For structures; wind. Frostburn is on top of a mountain on a river valley.
    Wind, particularly in the evenings can be strong, sustained, and
    gusty.</br></br>

    For you; staying warm, dry, fed, and hydrated.
